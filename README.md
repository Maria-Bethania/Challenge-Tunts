# Challenge Tunts.Rocks 2024 - Software Engineering

## Challenge Overview

    This repository contains the solution to the Tunts.Rocks 2024 Challenge for Software Engineering. 
    The challenge involves creating an application in Python to analyze student performance based on exam scores and attendance.
    The analysis includes calculating averages, determining student situations, and exploring correlations between variables.

## Tools and Libraries Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: Pandas, gspread (Google Sheets integration)
    Collaboration Platform: Google Colab

## Instructions for Running the Application

    Open the Google Colab notebook.
    Run each cell in sequential order to execute the code.
    Monitor the log lines and check the final results.

## Files in the Repository on Google Drive

    EngSoftTunts.csv: CSV file containing the student data after preprocessing.
    EngSoftTunts.xlsx: Excel file used for initial data extraction.
    Challenge_TuntsRocks_2024.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete code.

## Analysis Summary

    The analysis covers student situations based on exam scores and attendance.
    A correlation matrix reveals relationships between variables.
    Average absences and grades are analyzed for different student situations.
    
## Results and Insights

    A significant number of students (10) went to the Final Exam, indicating a borderline performance between pass and fail.
    Attendance is crucial, with 8 students failing due to absences.
    Only 1 student failed due to low grades, suggesting overall good performance in exams.
    
## Conclusion

    The analysis highlights the importance of both attendance and exam performance in determining student situations.        
    Recommendations for improvement can be tailored based on specific patterns observed in the data.
